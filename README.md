This project involves building a movie rental website using the ASP.NET MVC framework. I am working on this project because I am interested in developing websites with different web application frameworks. Specifically, I chose this project to learn the ASP.NET MVC framework while creating a functional movie rental platform.

To guide me through the process, I am following the Microsoft tutorial available at the link below:
